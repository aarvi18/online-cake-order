Problem Statement:
Create a Cake website that allows counter owners to advertise and sell their cakes. Rural
towns would be able to sell their commodities to the rest of the globe as a result of this.
The suggested method entails the creation of a Web app for a cake shop. The user can
purchase a nearby cake through the Website. An ECommerce App is a website that allows
developers to promote and sell their products.
The goal of this project is to establish a gateway that allows users to update product
information securely using the Website and to purchase things online.
